# üöÄ Deployment Steps for Payment Integration

## Current Status
‚úÖ Code pushed to GitHub (commits: QR scanner + Payment integration)
‚è≥ Vercel & Railway are auto-deploying now
‚ö†Ô∏è Need to run database migration after deployment

---

## Step 1: Wait for Deployment (5-10 minutes)

Your code is being deployed automatically:
- **Vercel** (Frontend): Check https://vercel.com/dashboard
- **Railway** (Backend): Check https://railway.app/dashboard

Wait until both show "Deployed" status.

---

## Step 2: Run Database Migration

Once Railway backend is deployed, run the migration to add ticket columns:

### Option A: Using Railway CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh
# OR
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Navigate to backend folder
cd ~/Desktop/fundify/backend

# Link to your Railway project (if not already linked)
railway link

# Run the migration
railway run node add-ticket-columns.js
```

### Option B: Using Railway Dashboard Variables

1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click on your **backend** service
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Copy the `DATABASE_URL` value
5. Run locally:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/fundify/backend
DATABASE_URL="<paste-railway-url>" node add-ticket-columns.js
```

### Option C: Direct Railway Shell

```bash
# Via Railway CLI
railway shell

# Then run
cd backend
node add-ticket-columns.js
exit
```

---

## Step 3: Verify Migration

You should see:
```
Adding ticket columns to EventRSVP table...
‚úì Added ticketCode column
‚úì Added isPaid column
‚úì Added paymentId column
‚úì Added checkedIn column
‚úì Added checkedInAt column
‚úì Added checkedInBy column
‚úì Added unique constraint on ticketCode
‚úì Created index on ticketCode
‚úì Created index on checkedIn

‚úÖ Migration completed successfully!
```

## Step 4: Test the Features

### Test QR Scanner:
1. Go to one of your events
2. RSVP as GOING
3. Click "View My Ticket"
4. See your QR code
5. As event host, go to `/events/{id}/checkin`
6. Scan the QR code
7. Verify check-in works

### Test Payment Integration:
1. Create a new event with:
   - Check "Premium Event"
   - Set a price (e.g., $10)
2. As a different user, go to that event
3. Click "I'm Going" button
4. Payment modal should appear
5. Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
6. Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
7. CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
8. Complete payment
9. Verify you get the ticket
10. Try to buy again - should prevent duplicate

## Step 5: Environment Variables Check

Make sure these are set in Railway:

```
DATABASE_URL=<auto-set-by-railway>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

And in Vercel:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<your-railway-backend-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Column already exists" error
This is fine! It means the migration already ran. Skip to testing.

### "Can't reach database" error
- Make sure DATABASE_URL is correct
- Check Railway service is running
- Verify database is connected in Railway dashboard

### Payment not working
- Check Stripe keys are set in Railway variables
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY is in Vercel
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure you're using test mode keys (sk_test_ / pk_test_)

### QR Scanner not opening camera
- Grant camera permissions in browser
- Try in HTTPS (production) not HTTP (localhost)
- Use Chrome/Edge (best compatibility)

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Check if Railway is linked
railway status

# View Railway logs
railway logs

# Check database connection
railway run npx prisma db pull

# Regenerate Prisma client on Railway
railway run npx prisma generate
```
