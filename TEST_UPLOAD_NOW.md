# 🧪 Test Upload - See What's Wrong

## ✅ What We Know:
- SUPABASE_URL exists in Railway ✅
- SUPABASE_ANON_KEY exists in Railway ✅
- Bucket is public ✅

## 🔍 What We Need to Check:

### 1. Bucket Name MUST be EXACTLY: `fundify-media`

Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xljawtuavcznqigmbrpt/storage/buckets

**Is your bucket name EXACTLY:**
- `fundify-media` ✅ (correct!)
- OR something else like: `fundify`, `media`, `images`, etc. ❌ (wrong!)

**If wrong:** 
- Delete old bucket
- Create new one named EXACTLY `fundify-media`

Do this RIGHT NOW:

1. Go to: https://funify.vercel.app/creator-dashboard/new-post
2. Upload ANY image
3. Click create post
4. **IMMEDIATELY:**
   - Open: Railway → Backend → Deployments → Latest → Logs
   - Search for: "Supabase" or "upload"

**You will see ONE of these:**

#### Option A: Success! ✅
```
🔄 Attempting Supabase upload for: image.jpg
   File path: /tmp/upload-xxx
   File size: 123456
   Target path in Supabase: images/1234567890-image.jpg
✅ Uploaded to Supabase: https://xljawtuavcznqigmbrpt.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/fundify-media/images/...
```
**This means IT'S WORKING!** ✅

#### Option B: Bucket Error ❌
```
🔄 Attempting Supabase upload for: image.jpg
❌ Supabase upload failed, falling back to local
   Error: Bucket not found
   OR: The resource was not found
```
**This means:** Bucket name is NOT `fundify-media`

#### Option C: Permission Error ❌
```
🔄 Attempting Supabase upload for: image.jpg
❌ Supabase upload failed, falling back to local
   Error: new row violates row-level security policy
   OR: Permission denied
   OR: 403 Forbidden
```
**This means:** Bucket needs RLS policies

#### Option D: Nothing / No Logs ❌
```
[No Supabase messages at all]
