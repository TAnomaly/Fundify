### 3. Create Test Creator Campaign

```

curl -X POST https://perfect-happiness-production.up.railway.app/api/campaigns \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "subscriber@test.com",

  -H "Authorization: Bearer SUBSCRIBER_TOKEN" \

    "tierId": "TIER_ID",
    "creatorId": "CREATOR_USER_ID"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "sessionId": "cs_test_...",
    "url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/..."
  }
}
```

### 6. Complete Payment Flow

1. Open the checkout URL in browser
2. Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
   - ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)
3. Complete payment
4. Should redirect to success page

### 7. Verify Webhook Received

Check Railway logs:
```bash
# Look for these logs:
Received webhook: checkout.session.completed
Processing checkout.session.completed: cs_test_...
Subscription created: sub_...
```

### 8. Verify Subscription in Database

```bash
curl https://perfect-happiness-production.up.railway.app/api/subscriptions/my-subscriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer SUBSCRIBER_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "status": "ACTIVE",
      "tier": {
        "name": "Basic Supporter",
        "price": 5
      },
      "creator": {
        "name": "Test Creator"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 9. Test Creator Dashboard

```bash
curl https://perfect-happiness-production.up.railway.app/api/subscriptions/my-subscribers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CREATOR_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "subscriptions": [
      {
        "subscriber": {
          "name": "Test Subscriber",
          "email": "subscriber@test.com"
        },
        "tier": {
          "name": "Basic Supporter",
          "price": 5
        }
      }
    ],
    "stats": {
      "totalSubscribers": 1,
      "monthlyRevenue": 5
    }
  }
}
```

### 10. Test Webhook with Stripe CLI (Optional)

If you want to test webhooks locally:

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4000/api/webhooks/stripe

# Trigger test event
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Receiving Events

1. Check Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your endpoint
2. Look at "Recent events" tab
3. Check for failed deliveries and error messages
4. Verify endpoint URL is correct
5. Check Railway logs for errors

### Checkout Session Creation Fails

- Verify user is authenticated (valid token)
- Verify tier exists and is active
- Check tier has not reached max subscribers
- Verify user doesn't already have active subscription to that creator

### Subscription Not Created After Payment

- Check Railway logs for webhook processing
- Verify webhook signature is correct
- Check database for subscription record
- Look for errors in webhook handler

### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Test database connection
curl https://perfect-happiness-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```
