# 🔍 Diagnostic Guide - Find The Problems

## 📦 What I Just Fixed:

**Added detailed error logging** to see EXACTLY why Supabase uploads are failing.

---

## ⏰ DO THIS IN 3 MINUTES (After Railway Redeploys):

### Step 1: Upload a Test Image

1. Go to your site: https://funify.vercel.app
2. Create a new post
3. Upload ANY image
4. **Keep watching!**

### Step 2: Check Railway Logs IMMEDIATELY

**Railway → Deployments → Latest → Logs**

**Look for these new messages:**

```bash
🔄 Attempting Supabase upload for: your-image.jpg
   File path: /tmp/...
   File size: 12345
   Target path in Supabase: images/1234567890-your-image.jpg
```

**Then ONE of these will appear:**

**✅ SUCCESS (Good!):**
```
✅ Uploaded to Supabase: https://xljawtuavcznqigmbrpt.supabase.co/storage/...
```

**❌ FAILURE (This is what we need to see!):**
```
❌ Supabase upload failed, falling back to local
   Error: [THE EXACT ERROR MESSAGE]
   Stack: [ERROR DETAILS]
   Bucket: fundify-media
   Make sure bucket exists and is PUBLIC in Supabase Storage!
```

---

## 🪣 Step 3: Check Supabase Bucket (Most Likely Problem!)

Go to: **https://supabase.com/dashboard**

1. **Find your project:** `xljawtuavcznqigmbrpt`
2. **Click "Storage"** in left sidebar
3. **Look for bucket named:** `fundify-media`

### Problem A: Bucket Doesn't Exist

**If you DON'T see `fundify-media` bucket:**

1. Click "Create bucket"
2. Name: `fundify-media` (exact spelling!)
3. **Check:** ✅ Public bucket
4. Click "Create"

### Problem B: Bucket is Private

**If bucket exists but says "Private":**

1. Click on `fundify-media` bucket
2. Click "⚙️" settings icon
3. Check: ✅ Public bucket
4. Click "Save"

### Problem C: Missing Policies

**If bucket exists and is public:**

1. Click on `fundify-media` bucket
2. Go to "Policies" tab
3. Click "New Policy"
4. Select "Allow Public Read Access"
5. Click "Review" → "Save"

---

## 🗄️ Step 4: Fix Database Tables

### Option A: Use Prisma (Easiest)

**Railway → Backend → Settings → "Open Terminal"**

Run:
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

This will force-create the tables.

### Option B: Manual SQL (If Option A fails)

1. **Get your DATABASE_URL** from Railway variables
2. **Go to:** https://neon.tech (or wherever your DB is hosted)
3. **Open SQL Editor**
4. **Copy and paste** the contents of `force-migration.sql`
5. **Run it**

## 📝 What to Tell Me:

After testing (in 3-5 minutes):

### 1. Supabase Upload Log:
Copy the **EXACT error** from Railway logs:
```
❌ Supabase upload failed, falling back to local
   Error: [COPY THIS EXACT ERROR]
```

### 2. Supabase Bucket Status:
- [ ] Bucket exists
- [ ] Bucket is Public
- [ ] Bucket has policies

### 3: Database Status:
Run this in browser console:
```javascript
fetch('https://perfect-happiness-production.up.railway.app/api/posts/likes', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('authToken') }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(d => console.log('Result:', d))
.catch(e => console.error('Error:', e));
```

Copy the result!

## 🎯 Most Likely Issues:

Based on your logs, I predict:

1. **Supabase bucket doesn't exist** (80% likely)
2. **Supabase bucket is private** (15% likely)
3. **Database tables don't exist** (100% certain)
