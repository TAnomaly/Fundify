🐛 CANCEL RSVP BUG - COMPLETELY FIXED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Problem Before:
- User clicks "Cancel RSVP"
- Attendee count stays the same ❌
- Cancel button still visible ❌
- RSVP record remains in database ❌

Solution:
✓ Backend now DELETES RSVP when status is NOT_GOING
✓ Uses deleteMany() instead of upsert for cancellations
✓ Attendee count decreases correctly
✓ Cancel button disappears
✓ Frontend state resets to null
✓ Clean database (no NOT_GOING records)

Code Change:
  if (status === 'NOT_GOING') {
    await prisma.eventRSVP.deleteMany({
      where: { userId, eventId }
    });
    return { success: true, data: null };
  }

📄 PDF TEXT POSITIONING - FIXED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Problem Before:
- QR code text overlapping ❌
- Words slipping over images ❌
- Emoji icons causing issues ❌

Solution:
✓ Removed emoji icons (used colored circles instead)
✓ Fixed all yPos calculations
✓ Increased spacing between sections
✓ QR code label 8mm below QR image
✓ All text properly aligned
✓ No overlapping elements
✓ Professional layout

Spacing Fixed:
- Header: 45mm
- Event title: Dynamic + 12mm
- Date box: 30mm + 7mm spacing
- Location box: 24mm + 8mm spacing
- Details section: 28mm + 6mm spacing
- QR section: 70mm + 8mm label + 12mm
- Footer: Bottom aligned
